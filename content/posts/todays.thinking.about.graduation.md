Today is June 2nd. I planned to interview Yuanfudao intern in Yanta District of Xi'an. Later, it will be postponed to tomorrow due to graduation photos.

To graduation photos, I don't actually have any expectations. If there must be an excuse, I think it is the novel coronavirus has given the particularity to the graduation season. But fundamentally speaking, there's no special surprise for me to do it, nobody, nothing. I know there are lots of regrets in the past four years, even heartbreaking and incapable of action. I don't want to be mentioned or recalled.

Sometimes, I suddenly find I'm different from others. They can be happy together, can play together, can start again without any burden. Yes, I can also, but I can't betray myself, especially my heart and things that I've been through, because all of things including myself, my heart and things I've experienced teach me to grow up and I don't want to back off. I just do myself, following my heart.

On the other hand, I have many friends. We do our own things, occasionally contact with each other. But we never forget everyone, and we can be happy together, play together. So why do the same things behave differently? I think the ideological gap is always insurmountable.

In the past four years, I still meet a great number of friends and can't take pictures with them, which is a pity. After all, no one can say when we will see each other when we leave the campus.

Maybe what I said above is abstract. But if that is not abstract, I have no necessity to think and write it here.

Okay, I wrote a tweet yesterday, because yesterday was June 1st children's day.

> Q: What was your dream as a child?

> A: Be a hero.

> Q: Now?

> A: As usual.
